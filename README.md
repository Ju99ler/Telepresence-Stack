MRX Robotics

The backbone of remote work.

MRX Robotics is building the universal backbone for telepresence and autonomy. Our robots are designed to cross industries, borders, and time zones — enabling operators anywhere to take action everywhere.

We start with low-latency telepresence systems powered by ROS 2, giving humans precise control over robots in kitchens, factories, and logistics hubs. Over time, our stack evolves toward semi-autonomous and fully autonomous operation, creating the infrastructure for Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS).

Vision
Our mission is to decentralize labor through robotics. 

## Core Components
