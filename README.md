# Telepresence-Stack
Robots should be built to share control with humans. This repo is the foundation for machines that can be operated from anywhere, by anyone, for any task.

# Telepresence Stack

The Telepresence Stack is an open-source robotics control framework designed to enable human operators to remotely control robots across diverse industries — including food service, construction, logistics, and more.

## Vision
Our mission is to decentralize labor through robotics. Instead of replacing workers, we move them — enabling one skilled operator to control robots anywhere in the world.

## Core Components
- Real-time video + control interface
- Modular robot hardware adapter system
- Human-in-the-loop task execution
- Training loop for autonomous transition

Licensed under Apache 2.0 – use it, build on it, scale it.
