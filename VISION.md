# Telepresence Stack Vision

**Mission:**  
To decentralize labor through robotics by making telepresence the universal control layer across industries.

**Why Telepresence?**  
Robots alone aren’t ready for full autonomy. Humans alone can’t scale globally.  
Telepresence combines the two:
- Humans handle edge cases and creativity.
- Robots handle physical execution.
- Data collected becomes training ground for future autonomy.

**Our Goal:**  
Create a standard, open framework for controlling robots from anywhere.  
From QSR kitchens to construction sites, from hospitals to warehouses – the same telepresence core will work with different robotic platforms.

**Long-Term Evolution:**  
1. **Telepresence-first** – immediate, practical, solves labor shortages.  
2. **Shared autonomy** – AI handles 80%, humans handle the edge cases.  
3. **Full autonomy** – robots operate independently, but always with human override.  

This project is the beginning of that timeline.
