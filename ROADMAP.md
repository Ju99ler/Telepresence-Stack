# Telepresence Stack Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the Telepresence Stack – from basic teleoperation to shared autonomy, and eventually full autonomy.  
The path is bold, incremental, and always rooted in real-world use.

---

## Phase 1: Telepresence (Now – Year 1)
- Core framework: input → network → robot motion
- Real-time video + operator interface
- Modular robot hardware adapter system
- Example implementations:
  - QSR (fast-food kitchen robot control)
  - Construction (drywall lift assistant)
- Goal: **Enable one remote operator to control any robot from anywhere**

---

## Phase 2: Shared Autonomy (Years 2–5)
- Integrate AI to assist with routine tasks
- Human-in-the-loop for edge cases
- Data logging for AI training
- Example:
  - Robot positions drywall, operator confirms and fastens
  - Robot fries and bags food, operator steps in for exceptions
- Goal: **1 operator supervises multiple robots (1:5, 1:10 scaling)**

---

## Phase 3: Autonomy with Override (Years 5–10)
- Robots handle majority of tasks independently
- Telepresence remains as fail-safe and override mechanism
- Data-driven optimization: robots improve continuously
- Industry-standard APIs for integration
- Goal: **Full autonomy possible, but always human override ready**

---

## Phase 4: Universal Labor Platform (Beyond 10 years)
- One control standard for global labor via robots
- Robots in restaurants, construction, logistics, healthcare – all on the same telepresence backbone
- Marketplaces emerge where operators can log in and work remotely across industries
- Goal: **Decentralize labor worldwide through robotics**

---

## Status
- ✅ Repository launched (Day 1)  
- ⬜ Core telepresence modules (in progress)  
- ⬜ First demo robot integration (to come)  
- ⬜ Alpha release of the framework  
- ⬜ Pilot program with partner franchise or contractor

**Note:** This roadmap is directional, not final. It will adapt as we learn, test, and build.  
The vision is ambitious, but the steps are practical.
